    - adding collections to the DB, means that, not only you can have separate databases, but you can have sub-collections inside them. An example: a database named "medicine" can have collections: of
      allergy, immunology, anesthesiology, dermatology, and radiology .... which you can choose from the UI when asking questions. When you perform and ingest you can specify --ingest-dbname and
      --collection, if you don't specify --collection it will be named as the database name. If you don't specify any of these arguments user will be prompted to enter the database (for now only
      supported in the terminal.
